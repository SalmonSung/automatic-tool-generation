# Guide: How to Start LangGraph Studio

1. **Install**  
   Install the CLI with in-memory support:
   ```bash
   pip install 'langgraph-cli[inmem]'
   ```

2. **Run the following command**  
   This will start a local server and open LangGraph Studio in your default web browser:
   ```bash
   langgraph dev
   ```

3. **Enter the file path and configure settings**  
   After launching, you’ll see a configuration screen in the browser.  
   Make sure to review the settings carefully — especially the **indexing option** — to match your use case.
