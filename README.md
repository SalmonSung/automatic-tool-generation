# Automatic Tool Generation

**Automatic Tool Generation** is a subproject of [*Create Data Scientist Agent*](doc/hyperproject.md)

The main goal of this project is to **automatically and independently generate tools** for use by LLM agents. Rather than manually predefining tools for every possible use case, this project introduces a pipeline that can:

1. **Analyze** the task type  
2. **Ideate** potential solutions  
3. **Generate** appropriate Python tools  
4. **Validate** them against sample data

This approach enables more flexible, scalable, and intelligent agents that can adapt to diverse data analysis scenarios without requiring human experts in tool preparation.
